# sass-director-sublime
A port of Sass Director for Sublime

Please visit the original Web Project by Una Kravet [HERE](https://github.com/una/sass-director)!

## Installation

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this plugin is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select Sass Director when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Sass Director up to date with the latest
version.

### Clone from GitHub

Alternatively, you can clone the repository directly from GitHub into your Packages directory:

    git clone https://github.com/Stephn-R/sass-director-sublime.git

## Usage

[Example Manifest File](https://github.com/Stephn-R/sass-director-sublime/blob/master/scss/sample-manifest.scss)

1. Open up your manifest file
2. Open the Command Palette and select "Sass Director: Generate Sass from Manifest File"
3. The Plugin will generate the directories and files relative to your Manifest File
4. ...
5. PROFIT!

## Future work

This Project was built upon ST3. Therefore, I have not validated with ST2 yet. If any issues do appear, do not hesitate to report them under our [Issues](https://github.com/Stephn-R/sass-director-sublime/issues)

##### And as always ~~ Happy Hacking!
